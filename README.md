# Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of codes and projects that I have developed over the years, written in: **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**.

## Languages Overview

### Python

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted language. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and many other fields. Its extensive standard library and active community contribute to its status as one of the most popular programming languages today.

### Java

**Java** is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is known for its portability across platforms, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java programs to run on any device that supports the JVM. Java is heavily used in large-scale enterprise environments, mobile applications (especially Android), and web applications. Its robust ecosystem and long-standing presence in the industry make it a critical language for many developers.

### C++

**C++** is a powerful, high-performance language that extends the C programming language with object-oriented features. It provides fine-grained control over system resources, making it ideal for system/software development, game development, and applications where performance is critical. C++ is widely respected for its efficiency and ability to handle low-level operations, but it also has a steep learning curve compared to higher-level languages. Understanding C++ is valuable for gaining a deep insight into how software interacts with hardware.
